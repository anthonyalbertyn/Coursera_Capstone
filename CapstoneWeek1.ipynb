    "### Background\n",
    "A quick online search will reveal that crime in New Your state has been falling since the 1990's but in 2019 there were still a significant number of felony-level crimes committed with a dangerous weapon. Teenagers can be on both ends, as perpetrators as well as victims, and can potentially suffer trauma and injury if they are about when these crimes are committed. The NYPD does publish crime statistics and various organisations create different kinds of crime maps to visulise the data. I could find various media reports on schools with highest crime reats, but these usually focused on a specific area, like Brooklyn, or were out of date, or did not break down the crimes down sufficiently or did not plot the schools on a map. The idea for this resarch was bourn when I realised that there was a gap in this information, and because of my preception of the need to do more to help teenagers in New Your state avoid violence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim\n",
    "The aim of the research is analyse crime data in New York city and relate that to nearby high schools to find the most at-risk schools where children could get caught up in serious violent crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cluster high schools in New York state by number of felonies commited, in 2019, withn a 500m radius of the school between the hours of 7am to 9am and 2pm to 6pm\n",
    "2. Find the top-twenty high schools in New York state with the highest ampunt of crimes determined in objective 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research question\n",
    "Which high schools in New York state had the highest number of felonies, involving a dangerouse weapon, in 2019?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audience\n",
    "The research may be of interest to law enforecement, education authorities and social support organisations in New York state who have an interest in protecting teenagers from serious crime committed near their schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value\n",
    "The reaearch will be important to this audience because it can help identify areas and high schools where school children are at risk of being harmed by serious crime, and allow the authorities to identify where best to focus limited resources to tackle the problem."

    "Data set: NYPD Complaint Data Historic  \n",
    "Resource link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i  \n",
    "Columns of data: 35  \n",
    "Rows of data: 6.5 million  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Data extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be extracted as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The research will filter the NYPD Complaint data by year (2019), level of crime (felony), description of crime (dangerous weapon), time of crime (between 7am to 9pm and between 2pm to 6pm) and crime successfull (true).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The latitude and longitude data for each of these felonies will then be used to do an API call to Fouresquare to find venues with category 'high school' within a radous of 500m from the crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A list of these high schools, including their venue id, name, city, latitude and longitude data will be compiled. None of these high schools will have no felonies near it because they were found by their distance from a felony.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The list of schools will then be cleaned and grouped by venue id, and a count column will be added - so we know how many crimes found this school as a venue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be used in analysis as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. K-means ML analysis will be applied to the high school data to cluster the schools my level of felony crime and a cluster label will be added to the school data in a new column\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The high school data will be sorted in descending order by number of delonies committed nearby and the top twenty records will be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data visulisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be visulised as follows  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot felony crimes on its own map using Folium\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Plot high schools clusters on a map sing Folium\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Print top twenty high schools including the total number of crimes for each school\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plot the top twenty high schools on a map using Folium.\n",
